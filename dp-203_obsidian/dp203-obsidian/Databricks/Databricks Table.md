- In Azure Databricks, you can also create a database and tables
- The table is a collection of structured data
- You can then perform operations on the data that are supported by Apache Spark on DataFrames on Azure Databricks tables
- There are two types of tables â€“ global and local tables.
- A global table is available across all clusters
- A global table is registered in the Azure Databricks Hive metastore or an external metastore
- The local table is not accessible from other clusters and is not registered in the Hive metastore
